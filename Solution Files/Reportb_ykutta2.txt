3) Happiest State Sentiment Scores:

a) The formula used to calculate the average sentiment score for each state is :

		Average Sentiment score for each state = Sum of Sentiment Score of each tweet for the state\ Total Number of tweets of the state

b) 51 states of the US are considered, along with 5 terrorises (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States) taken from the wikipedia page. The dictionary can be found in the python file as  “stateabbr_dict”
c) Out of the 3 available options for choosing the location of each tweet, the one more appropriate founded is User.Location. This is because this attribute returns the most filled locations, as in not null values. The “Places” attribute is null in a lot of cases and hence information retrieved is very less. Similarly the Co-ordinates attribute is null in most tweets retrieved , as well as this returns coordinates which is harder to map to the state without the use of geocoded dictionaries.Thus, the most feasible one is Location which is chosen for this problem.

The 5 happiest states with their average sentiment scores, in descending order, are:

4.0 : CT
3.0 : ID
2.6666666666666665 : IA
2.6666666666666665 : SC
2.6666666666666665 : ME

The 5 unhappiest states with their average sentiment scores,in descending order, are:

-1.0 : WY
-1.0 : AZ
-0.6666666666666666 : IL
-0.5 : KY
-0.4 : LA

Implementation Details:

The user.location attribute value is matched with the abbreviations of the state as well as its full form and then resolved to only abbreviation for best results.
